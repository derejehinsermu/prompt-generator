- **Automatic Prompt Generation**: Efficiently creates prompts for high-quality content.
- **Evaluation Data Generation**: Automates the creation of diverse test cases for better QA.
- **Prompt Testing and Ranking**: Assesses and ranks prompts to improve outcomes.
- **Advanced Language Processing**: Utilizes GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 for precise results.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Employs Chroma for reliable data storage and retrieval.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x and pip (usually bundled with Python installation)
- Git installed on your machine
- Virtualenv (install using pip):
  ```bash
  pip install virtualenv

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/derejehinsermu/prompt_generator.git

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   
    Navigate to the root directory of the project and create a virtual environment named 'venv', then activate it:
    ```sh
    cd prompt_generator.git
    python -m venv venv  | virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install Requirements**\
   
    While inside the virtual environment, install the project requirements:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    
## Usage

To run the Contract Q&A Bot:

1. **Start the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run stream_app.py


2. **Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the bot.**
